An opinionated way for Flowdock notifications to be sent from a Jenkins Pipeline.

The library must be available to the pipeline in some way. Either as implicitly available library, or using

```library 'flowdockNotifications'```

Then call `notifyFlowdock` in the appropriate _step_-level block. This is most likely in the `post` action of the pipeline.

Example
-------

```
library 'flowdockNotifications'

pipeline {
    ...
    post {
        always {
            notifyFlowdock(this, '#############', '#with-tags')
        }
    }
}
